document:
only works on the same machine as SQL Server.
document using SQL authenticated accounts.
backup strategies with full log and diffs.
which compression should I use?
How do they compare?

roadmap:
gui
add command line option to check to see if file exists with overwrite or not.
when overwriting a file, don't destroy/recreate, but overwrite in place to preserve a defraged file.
set inital file size based on backup size estimate then trim back down to actuall file size prevents file fragmentation.
Build an installer.
CLR stored procedure helpers.
Multiplex file streams to a single file.

Suggested Plugins
Database plugins:
Pipeline plugins:
7z plugin
Encryption Pipeline plugins:
Blowfish
3DES
Resource Governor plugins:
cpu
Storage plugins:
ftp plugin
sftp plugin

done:
striped backups
Needs a completion message with stats: MB/s, MB read, MB written, compression ratio, etc
Rijendel encryption plugin
LZ4 plugin
zip plugin
restore header only
restore file list only
restore verify only

regressions:
make it SQL 2000 compatible.
Current query to pull header and file detail only works with 2005 and above
